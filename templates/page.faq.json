Hemp is a strain of cannabis sativa whereas marijuana – colloquially called cannabis - may be cannabis sativa, cannabis indica or cannabis ruderalis. Generally, marijuana will contain a high amount of THC but a low amount of CBD. However, hemp has a very high level of CBD and only a very small amount of THC.<\/p><p>The plants look different too. Although there are a number of different strains of hemp, the plants tend to be taller and more fibrous than marijuana which is a smaller, bushier plant and often with more flowering buds. In addition to being a source of CBD, the strength of the hemp plant makes it suitable for a wide range of uses, including building materials and paper, whereas marijuana’s uses are normally limited to the extraction of cannabinoids for recreational and medicinal purposes.<\/p>"
